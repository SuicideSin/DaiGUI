DaiGUI
======

DaiGUI is a WildStar addon library designed to allow addon developers the ability to create UI windows and components in-game with a Lua table.

DaiGUI offers the following features:
* UI creation from a lua table
* Inline event handlers
* Nested children
* Pixie support
* Assign data to parent and children

A utility, [Houston2DaiGUI](https://github.com/daihenka/Houston2DaiGUI), has been developed to convert Houston generated Form XML files into DaiGUI tables.  This allows the use of Houston to prototype designs and export to DaiGUI tables.

## Demos

There are two demo addons in [examples/](examples/) that showcase various methods on the uses of DaiGUI.
